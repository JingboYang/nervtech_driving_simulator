# Description of Data

Data from a select set of 5 drivers are included in the [sample_data](/sample_data) folder. 10 seconds of data sampled at 100Hz is included for each of the 4 road areas that these drivers drove on.

Columns are:
* `ACCELERATION`: acceleration in X axis
* `ACCELERATION_PEDAL`: whether acceleration pedal is pressed
* `ACCELERATION_Y`: acceleration in Y axis
* `ACCELERATION_Z`: acceleration in Z axis
